##3.4 What does it mean to preempt a process?

It was an act where the operating system interrupts a task temporarily without requiring its cooperation is preempt process. 
or
If a process moving from RUNNING state to READY state is called a preempt process. 
In this process involuntarily gives up the
CPU. 


##3.5 What is swapping and what is its purpose?

AN older form of memory management where the memory is moved at a single time from main memory to the secondary storage memory/disk is called swapping.
This scheme is also known as roll-in/roll-out.Due to many running processes in memory there will be much slower then computation 
In these cases CPU will not have any type of work. 
So, when no process in main memory are in the ready state then operating system would swap one of its processes into disk.And brings in either a new process from the suspended queue or a new-process request.


##3.9 List three general categories of information in a process control block?

There are three categories of information in a process control block.They are

1.Process Identification

2.Processor State information

3.Process Control information

when we discuss these in detail:

1.Process Identification:The Identification of the process like the process ID, or ID of parent processes, and an identifier for the user.

2.Processor State information:It give the informations of program counter, status registers and general-purpose
registers.

3.Process Control information: Will deal with information like process state and its priority,scheduling-relatedinformation/amount of time waiting and executed and identity of event. 
It also give information about Data structuring,where a process may be linked to other process in a queue,Memory management ,Resource ownership and utilization,Process privileges and Interprocess communication.


##3.10 Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed?.

Just because for the saftey we are using these two modes.
Kernel and User will see protect a user from interfering with the remaining.
complete control of the processor, registers, and memory.

##3.12 What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?

A trap is an exception in a user process(divided by zero),where interrupt is generated by the hardware like hard disk, etc
Trap Handling is synchronous,so the user code is suspended and continues afterwards.
where interrupts are asynchronous,since the interrupt handler has to wait for them to happen eventually.
But a common thing is they changes the state of a process.

##3.13 Give three examples of an interrupt?.
 
1.Internal interrupts:commonly known as exception errors,such as a divide by zero, or unknown opcode.

2.External interrupt: which is generally caused by hardware problem,where a device requests the processor for example I/O devices

3.Software interrupts:after coding is done during the process of excecution these interrupts causes.

##3.14 What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?

The process switch is the process state between the status like read,suspend,etc.
This will come under the concept called as context switching.Kernel can cause a context switch.
Preemption will be the cause for this. 
Mode switch is the switch the process privilege between the mode like use mode, kernel mode.
Generally a mode switch is considered less expensive compared to a process switch. 
A mode switch must occur for a software context switch to occur.
